#Manual for A2DP Connect widget.

# Introduction #

A2DP Connect is a simple widget used to connect to A2DP audio Bluetooth devices.  Generally these devices do not auto connect so the user must navigate through "system settings" -> "wireless & networks" -> "Bluetooth" and then find the device you want to connect to and click it.  This widget lets you put an icon on the home screen that gives you quick access to connect and disconnect the A2DP streaming device easily.

Note:  This is a widget, not an app.  It does not show up in your apps.  Pre-Android 4 you simply long press on an open spot on one of your home screens.  Android 4 and up you select the widgets tab in the apps drawer.  Get more help here: http://support.google.com/android
